Headlines Africa is only for people 13

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">DISCLAIMERS</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Headlines Africa
is provided “as is” without any warranties, express or implied.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Headlines Africa
disclaims all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To the fullest extent allowed by law,
Headlines Africa shall not be liable for
any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages,
or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or
indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill or other intangible
losses resulting from (A) your access to, use of, inability to access
or inability to use Headlines Africa;
(B) any third party conduct or content on Headlines
Africa, including any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct
of third parties; or (C) any unauthorized access, use or alteration
of your content.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ARBITRATION</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you become disgruntled with
Headlines Africa for any reason, we’d
like the opportunity to work out our differences informally. We
strongly encourage you to contact us at theheadlinesafrica@gmail.com,
and we’ll do our best to resolve the dispute in good faith. We’re
reasonable people, really.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If we aren’t able to solve the
problem that way, we both agree that we will resolve any claims
arising from these Terms or the Headlines
Africa service by final and binding arbitration through the
American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
Disputes. If you win an arbitration award that’s more generous than
any offer we made to settle the dispute, Headlines
Africa will pay you $1,500 on top of the award.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arbitration will take place in the
United States County where you live or work, Palo Alto, California or
another location we both agree upon. Either of us may file a lawsuit
in court solely for injunctive relief against the other to stop
misuse of Headlines Africa or
intellectual property infringement without first going through
arbitration.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You agree to resolve any dispute you
have with us on an individual basis in arbitration, and not as a
class arbitration, class action or consolidated proceeding of any
kind.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Terms will be governed by the
laws of the State of California, except for its conflict of laws
principles.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For claims that aren’t subject to
arbitration, we each agree that any such claims shall be litigated
exclusively in a state court located in Santa Clara County,
California or in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in
those courts.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ENTIRE AGREEMENT</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Terms and our Privacy Policy
constitute the entire agreement between you and Headlines
Africa. If any provision of these Terms is found to be
unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue to be in full
force and effect.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">MODIFICATION</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Terms may be modified from time
to time. The date of the most recent revisions will always be at
headlinesafrica.co and older versions
are available upon request. If we make changes that we believe will
substantially alter your rights, we will notify you by posting a
notice on our website. You agree to accept any changes or revisions
to these Terms by continuing to use Headlines
Africa.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CONTACT</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We welcome all questions, concerns and
feedback you might have about these terms. If you have suggestions
for us, let us know at theheadlinesafrica@gmail.com.</P>
