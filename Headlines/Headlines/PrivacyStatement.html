<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you create an account with
<FONT COLOR="#e36c0a">Headlines Africa</FONT>, you give us your full
name and email address, and create a username and password. If you
want, you can give us a pseudonym instead of your legal name.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you don’t feel like creating an
account from scratch, you may be able to sign in through an account
you already have with another service, such as Facebook.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Your user profile helps you customize
your account and you can also add a profile picture. Your profile
automatically includes your name and username. 
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We receive some other information
automatically when you use <FONT COLOR="#e36c0a">Headlines Africa</FONT>.
This includes data about your device, software, operating system,
operating system- provided device or user-specific advertising IDs
for advertisement tracking (“Advertising IDs”), your IP address
and the date and time of each request you make to <FONT COLOR="#e36c0a">Headlines

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So that we can make your <FONT COLOR="#e36c0a">Headlines
Africa</FONT> experience better, we collect information about how you

information through that service. This information varies depending
on the service and your privacy settings there, but may include
profile information (e.g., age, gender and location), your contacts
on that service and content that you’ve made publicly available
there.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you want to email something you see

18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)). We may disclose your information without
