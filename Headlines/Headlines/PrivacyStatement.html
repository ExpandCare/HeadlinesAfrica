<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you create an account with
Headlines Africa, you give us your full
name and email address, and create a username and password. If you
want, you can give us a pseudonym instead of your legal name.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you don’t feel like creating an
account from scratch, you may be able to sign in through an account
you already have with another service, such as Facebook.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Your user profile helps you customize
your account and you can also add a profile picture. Your profile
automatically includes your name and username. 
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You may link your Headlines
Africa account to other services you use, such as social
networking sites, photo-sharing services and media publishers such as
the New York Times. If you connect your Headlines
Africa account with a third-party service, we collect
information through that service. This information varies depending
on the service and your privacy settings there, but may include
profile information (e.g., age, gender and location), your contacts
on that service and content that you’ve made publicly available
there.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you want to email something you see
through Headlines Africa to a friend who

sending such email and improving our services. Recipients may contact
us at theheadlinesafrica@gmail.com to
request that we remove this information from our database.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR
